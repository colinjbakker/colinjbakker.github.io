			<h1>FPS Game</h1>
			<p>
				<a href="https://github.com/colinjbakker/FPSGame2">FPS Game</a> is my most recent project. It aims
				to imitate fast paced games like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1229490/ULTRAKILL/">ULTRAKILL</a> or, I 
				have been told, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/824270/KovaaKs/">Kovaak's</a>

				I originally planned to use OpenGL, as a follow up to my Pong game. However, I was advised by
				Twitter to use raylib instead, so that is what I went with. Raylib is incredibly well documented, so, for the 
				first time, I was able to generate a graphical window with the help of only the raylib samples and cheatsheet. 
				I made use of a more object-oriented approach, separating out different parts of the game, such as the player, enemies,
				and projectiles into structs to be created and destroyed as needed within the game. This helped me keep the code more organized
				and readable compared to my previous projects. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The biggest challenge for me so far, was understanding the transformations required to make a 3d camera work. I 
				used a little linear algebra in my bouncing window project, but this was my first application of linear algebra in 
				3 dimensions. Also, I have no experience in game development, so I am learning how to properly implement movement 
				and level generation in a way that is actually fun and engaging. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Currently the game has you endlessly shooting black capsules. I want to implement upgrades for the player, different weapons, 
				and a more robust movement system. I also want to look into importing and rendering meshes for the enemy and player. As 
				I learn more about computer graphics over the course of my current semester, I want to implement better visuals to this game.

			<h1>Bouncing Window</h1>
			<p>
				<a href="https://github.com/colinjbakker/BouncingWindow">Bouncing Window</a> is an application
				window that moves around the screen and rotates according to physics rules. It is also interactive,
				able to be dragged by the user. This app was inspired by the fidget spinner, aiming to be an application someone 
				could fling around their screen when they are bored, or when they are thinking. 
			</p>

				This project was created in C++ using the wxWidgets library. I recieved a lot of help from
				<a href="https://youtu.be/FOIbK4bJKS8?feature=shared">this video</a> by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@javidx9">javidx9</a>
				for linking the library to my Visual Studio project, and getting a window running. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The key feature that I am most proud of is the simulation of rotation and angular velocity. It was also
				the greatest challenge. From my research, application windows cannot rotate. Obviously, this is not a feature
				that is required by many applications. However, I was not satisfied with the original version, without rotation.
			</p>
			<img src="bouncingwindowgif.gif" width="300px">
			<p>
				My solution was to create bitmaps. wxWidgets had support for changing the shape of a window using bitmaps, typically
				used when an application wants a custom shaped splach screen on startup. I algorithmically created bitmaps 
				for each angle between zero and ninety degrees, which would be switched between to represent the calculated angle of
				the window. Unfortunately, this method meant that the title bar had to be removed, including the x button. 
				I would have liked the title bar to rotate with the application window, but at the moment, I am still investigating how 
				this can be done. As a compromise, I stuck an x button in the center so that the application can at least be closed in 
				the meantime.  
			</p>
			<p>
				This was the first project that I created that could be run on other people's computers without issue, the only
				issue being that the user is given a warning by windows defender when they try and run it. In the future I plan to 
				recreate this application with better coding style, the current implementation is a complete mess. I would also like to refine
				the physics simulation. I do not have much physics education, so my implementation came out looking a little janky, especially 
				with rotation. I would also like to reimplement the title bar, if it is possible.
			</p>
			<h1>Pong</h1>
			<p>
				<a href="https://github.com/colinjbakker/Pong">Pong</a> is a very simple game
				I created to gain a better understanding of computer graphics and GUI, and the 
				use of libraries. With the help of 
				<a href="https://learnopengl.com/">learnopengl.com</a> written by 
				<a href="https://joeydevries.com/#home">Joey de Vries</a>, I used OpenGL, GLFW, and 
				GLAD libraries. I will not lie, I was a little out of my depth. I decided to keep
				the game simple, graphically. I spent most of my time making the AI as good as possible.
				It follows the ball when it is moving towards the player, and as soon as the player's paddle
				hits the ball, it calculates the path and moves to intercept it at the point on the paddle that
				causes the ball to move at a difficult-to-predict angle. I learned how I can link C++
				libraries and build to executables using Visual Studio.
			</p>

			<p>
				Unfortunately, for some reason
				I am not sure of, when the executable is downloaded and run from GitHub, the player paddle
				is invisible. I am still not totally comfortable with OpenGL, but I am currently enrolled in 
				computer graphics, where we will be building all of out projects with OpenGL. Hopefully, over the 
				course of this semester I am able to fully grasp OpenGL and am able to make better OpenGL projects.
