			<h1>FPS Game</h1>
			<p>
				<a href="https://github.com/colinjbakker/FPSGame2">FPS Game</a> is my most recent project. It aims
				to be a fast paced shooter similar to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1229490/ULTRAKILL/">ULTRAKILL</a> or, I 
				have been told, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/824270/KovaaKs/">Kovaak's</a> 
			</p>

				I originally planned to use OpenGL as a follow up to my Pong game. However, after some research, I decided to use 
				<a href="https://www.raylib.com/">raylib</a> instead. Raylib is incredibly well documented and has lots of example code,
				so for the first time I was able to sart this project without the help of a video guide. 
				I made use of a more object-oriented approach, separating out different parts of the game, such as the player, enemies,
				and projectiles into structs to be created and destroyed as needed within the game. This helped me keep the code more organized
				and readable compared to my previous projects. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The biggest challenge for me so far was understanding the transformations required to make a 3d camera. I 
				used a little linear algebra in my bouncing window project, but this was my first application of linear algebra in 
				three dimensions. I took linear algebra last year, but hadn't applied it or fully understood it until now. I also do 
				not have experience with game development, it is challenging to make the game engaging and fun, and the amount of features
				needed to make a complete game is daunting. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Currently the game has you endlessly shooting black capsules. I want to implement upgrades for the player, different weapons, 
				a more robust movement system, and different levels, potentially bosses. I also want to look into importing and rendering meshes 
				for the enemy and player and improving the graphics with lighting as I learn more about computer graphics in my course this semester.

			<h1>Bouncing Window</h1>
			<p>
				<a href="https://github.com/colinjbakker/BouncingWindow">Bouncing Window</a> is an application
				window that moves around the screen and rotates according to physics rules. It is also interactive,
				able to be dragged by the user. It aimsw to be an application someone 
				can fling around their screen when they are bored or when they are thinking like a digital fidget spinner. 
			</p>

				This project was created in C++ using the wxWidgets library. I recieved a lot of help from
				<a href="https://youtu.be/FOIbK4bJKS8?feature=shared">this video</a> by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@javidx9">javidx9</a>
				for linking the library to my Visual Studio project and getting a window running. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The key feature that I am most proud of is the simulation of rotation and angular velocity. It was also
				the greatest challenge. From my research, application windows cannot rotate. Obviously, this is not a feature
				that is required by many applications. However, I was not satisfied with the original version, without rotation.
			</p>
			<img class="gif" src="resources/gifs/bouncingwindowgif.gif" width="300px">
			<p>
				My solution was to create bitmaps. wxWidgets had support for changing the shape of a window using bitmaps, typically
				used when an application wants a custom shaped splach screen on startup. I algorithmically created bitmaps 
				for each angle between zero and ninety degrees, which would be switched between to represent the calculated angle of
				the window. Unfortunately, this method meant that the title bar had to be removed, including the x button. 
				I would have liked the title bar to rotate with the application window, but at the moment, I am still investigating how 
				this can be done. As a compromise, I stuck an x button in the center so that the application can at least be closed in 
				the meantime.  
			</p>
			<p>
				This was the first project that I created that could be run on other people's computers without issue, the only
				issue being that the user is given a warning by windows defender when they try and run it. In the future I plan to 
				recreate this application with better coding style, the current implementation is a complete mess. I would also like to refine
				the physics simulation. I do not have much physics education, so my implementation came out looking a little janky, especially 
				with rotation. I would also like to reimplement the title bar, if it is possible.

			<h1>Pong</h1>
			<p>
				<a href="https://github.com/colinjbakker/Pong">Pong</a> is a very simple game
				I created to gain a better understanding of computer graphics and GUI, and the 
				use of libraries. With the help of 
				<a href="https://learnopengl.com/">learnopengl.com</a> written by 
				<a href="https://joeydevries.com/#home">Joey de Vries</a>, I used OpenGL, GLFW, and 
				GLAD libraries. I will not lie, I was a little out of my depth. I decided to keep
				the game simple, graphically. I spent most of my time making the AI as good as possible.
				It follows the ball when it is moving towards the player, and as soon as the player's paddle
				hits the ball, it calculates the path and moves to intercept it at the point on the paddle that
				causes the ball to move at a difficult-to-predict angle. I learned how I can link C++
				libraries and build to executables using Visual Studio.
			</p>
			<img class="gif" src="resources/gifs/pong.gif" width="300px">
			<p>
				Unfortunately, for some reason
				I am not sure of, when the executable is downloaded and run from GitHub, the player paddle
				is invisible. I am still not totally comfortable with OpenGL, but I am currently enrolled in 
				computer graphics, where we will be building all of out projects with OpenGL. Hopefully, over the 
				course of this semester I am able to fully grasp OpenGL and am able to make better OpenGL projects.

			<h1>Wordle Clone</h1>
			<p>
				Wordle clone is a project that I, unfortunately, cannot share the source code for because 
				it was my final project for my programming languages course. I will include this gif however.
			</p>
			<img class="gif" src="resources/gifs/wordle.gif" width="300px">
			<p>
				This project made use of the Java programming language and the JavaFX library. This was the first
				time that I had ever created a graphical project (excluding html), and this was the project that
				sparked my interest in creating GUI programs and games. Although my professor implored us to use 
				<a href="https://gluonhq.com/products/scene-builder/">SceneBuilder</a>, I decided to program all of 
				the GUI elements manually at the advice of <a href="https://www.pragmaticcoding.ca/beginners/intro">this article</a>
				by Dave Barrett. His guide was also taught me the model-view-controller design pattern, which I implemented
				in this project. I gained a ton of knowledge about how to use libraries, how events are handled by GUI applications,
				and how GUI programs should be organized in large part thanks to this decision to not use SceneBuilder.
			</p>
			<h1>Mouse Distance Tracker</h1>
			<p>
				<a href="https://github.com/colinjbakker/mouse-distance-tracker">Mouse Distance Tracker</a> was a fun
				quick project I created in about an hour during some down time in my internship. It's purpose was to track 
				how far, in meters, my mouse moved over the course of the remainder of my internship.
			</p>
			<img class="gif" src="resources/gifs/mdt.gif" width="300px">
			<p>
				I created this little widget using Python and the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html">tkinter</a>,
				<a href="https://pypi.org/project/PyAutoGUI/">pyautogui</a> and <a href="https://pypi.org/project/screeninfo/">screeninfo</a> 
				modules. This was very simple, and honestly I didn't learn much, but it was fun and also surprising how many 
				kilometers I traveled. If I remembered the distance I would write it here.
